    ">\"The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician, eugenicist, and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gasp√© Peninsula \"all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus\" - [paperswithcode]https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/iris-1\n",
    "\n",
    "Put simply; The Iris dataset comprises measurements from three different species of iris flowers - namely, Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica. For these three species, the following variables belong: Sepal Length - the length of the flower's outer petal, Sepal Width - the Width of the flower's outer petal, Petal Length - the length of the flower's inner petal and Petal Width - the width of the flower's inner petal. This incredibly popular dataset is used in the world of data anaytics and machine learning as its simple, clear structure, versatility and beginner friendliness makes it an ideal starting point for beginners - such as myself - to see and visualise how key concepts work. Concept like data exploration, visualisation, benchmarking, predictive analysis etc tio name but a few. "

As pointed out by my professor Ian - this is deparate and quite different from a relative zero such as, for example - 0 degrees Celcius. This is a relative 0 as it means the temperature is that of the freezing point of water rather that representing that 0 celcius mrepresents 0 heat, which is not the case. \n",

    " - **Sepal Width** Mean is 3.06 cm rounded. Range goes from 2 - 4.4cm, which is notably less than Sepal Length. This shows it is standard dev of 0.43cm, approximately half the variability. The distribution here is, like Sepal Length, somewhat of a symmetrical distribution as shown by its mean value of 3.05cm being only slightly greater than its median value of 3cm. \n",

    " **Petal Length** Mean is approx 3.76 cm. Higest standard deviation of all variables at a rounded 1.77cm. This shows with a relatively huge range of 1-6.9cm, the largest range of all the vars, naturally. The distribution here is left skewed as shown by a median of 4.35, much higher than its mean of 3.75. \n",
