    ">\"The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician, eugenicist, and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gasp√© Peninsula \"all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus\" - [paperswithcode]https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/iris-1\n",
    "\n",
    "Put simply; The Iris dataset comprises measurements from three different species of iris flowers - namely, Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica. For these three species, the following variables belong: Sepal Length - the length of the flower's outer petal, Sepal Width - the Width of the flower's outer petal, Petal Length - the length of the flower's inner petal and Petal Width - the width of the flower's inner petal. This incredibly popular dataset is used in the world of data anaytics and machine learning as its simple, clear structure, versatility and beginner friendliness makes it an ideal starting point for beginners - such as myself - to see and visualise how key concepts work. Concept like data exploration, visualisation, benchmarking, predictive analysis etc tio name but a few. "
