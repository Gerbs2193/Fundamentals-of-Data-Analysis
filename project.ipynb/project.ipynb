    "\n",
    "1. Understanding the Iris Dataset: Explain and examine the Fischer data set to learn where it comes from and why it's important for identifying the ifferent types of iris flowers. Also, look at the significance of this data set within data analytics. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variable Classification and Measurement Scales: Simply put, this objective is concerned with sorting the Iris Species and variables based on what they are and how they behave. Specifically, using mathematical and statistical methods like sorting them into three groups; Nominal variables, Ordinal variables and  interval and Ratio variables\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Statistical Profiling: For the iris species, calculate frequency counts which can give an insight into the distributions of each within the iris.\n",
    "For the variables, use data spread to calculate the variance and standard deviation. This could be good as it will help to understand\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective Data Visualization:\n",
    "Choose the right way to make simple pictures that help us understand the data better. It's like making graphs in math class. These pictures make it easy for everyone to see and understand the data.\n",
    "Interpreting Data Insights:\n",
    "We'll look at the numbers and pictures we made and try to figure out what they're telling us. It's like reading a story about the iris flowers and what makes them different. We'll also connect this to real-world uses.\n",
    "Communicating Findings Clearly:\n",
    "Put all our findings into a notebook, just like telling a story. We want everyone to understand, even if they're not experts in coding. So, we're keeping it clear and simple.\n",
    "Real-World Significance and Applications:\n",
    "Discuss why this dataset is important and how people use it. Think of it as understanding the secrets of iris flowers and why it matters in science and computers."
