    "\n",
    "1. Understanding the Iris Dataset: Explain and examine the Fischer data set to learn where it comes from and why it's important for identifying the ifferent types of iris flowers. Also, look at the significance of this data set within data analytics. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variable Classification and Measurement Scales: Simply put, this objective is concerned with sorting the Iris Species and variables based on what they are and how they behave. Specifically, using mathematical and statistical methods like sorting them into three groups; Nominal variables, Ordinal variables and  interval and Ratio variables\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Statistical Profiling: For the iris species, calculate frequency counts which can give an insight into the distributions of each species within the iris.\n",
    "For the variables, use **data spread** to calculate the variance and standard deviation. This could be good as it will help to understand the spead of the data and the degree of variability of the variablees. Calculkate the meeem, median and mode for the variables which helps provide ifo about the data values and the patterns if any. Determine the range between the variables. This is good to know the span of nthe values within. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data Visualisation: Where appropriate, make use of bar-charts, box plots, scatter plots, and more data visualisation techniques to make it accessible ajnd easy to understand what the data is saying to us. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Interpretation of the Data: What exactly are the diagrams\\charts etc telling us? What was the whole point of the visualisation? Explained here. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Accessible Communication. As a novice mysemf, making the findings accessible and easy to understand comes naturally. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Real-World Significance and Applications: Why is the Fischer dataset so famous and how is it used for prctial purposes in the real-world of computing and data-analysis\n",

    ">\"The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician, eugenicist, and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gasp√© Peninsula \"all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus\" - [paperswithcode]https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/iris-1"
